    	<h3 style="font-weight: lighter; font-size:35px; padding: 0px;"> How did we get this number?</h3><h3>
            It is important to take into account that there are not many sources and exact numbers for the calculation we are providing. Despite our research, it is almost impossible to find a perfectly accurate number.
             </h3></div>

    	<div class="box3">
        <h3 style="font-weight: lighter;">We did find that big companies such as Google or Amazon use up an extremely huge amount of electricity to power their Data Centers, that are used to store all the material needed on their websites.
        <br><br>From Google's recently published paper "<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//green/pdf/achieving-100-renewable-energy-purchasing-goal.pdf">Achieving Our 100% Renewable Energy Purchasing Goal and Going Beyond</a>", it is stated that the company's data centers consume approximately 5.7 Terawatt hours annually, which is comparable to the whole city of San Francisco's annual electricity consumption.
        <br><br>
        Wikipedia's article about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exabyte">Exabytes</a> states the following :
    </h3> <h3 style="font-size: 17px; padding-right: : 20px; padding-left: 30px;"> In 2013, Randall Munroe compiled published assertions about Google's data centers, and estimated that the company has about 10 exabytes stored on disk, and additionally approximately 5 exabytes on tape backup.
    </h3>
    <h3>Counting 15 exabytes (1 Exabyte = 1 billion Gigabytes) as for Google Data Center's material in relation with 5.7 Terawatt hours electricity, we are able to connect both values and make other conversions.
    </div>

    <div class="box2">
        <h3 style="font-weight: lighter; font-size:35px; padding: 0px; text-align: right;text-align: right;">Calculations</h3><h3>
            With a simple rule of three and converting the values to Kilo Bytes and Watts, we get the number displayed above. <br><Br>For example, if the files selected are about 64 MBs, the algorithm will convert the value into KBs by dividing by 1024 (64/1024) and will multiply the number by 380, which is the ration between Data (Bytes) and Energy (Watts) from Google Data Center's numbers.</h3>
            <br><br><h3 style="text-align: center;">64 / 1024 * 380 = 24</h3>
            <br><br><h3>This means that a device using up 24 Watts being on for an hour is the equivalent of storing these 64 MBs of data in The Cloud.</h3>
